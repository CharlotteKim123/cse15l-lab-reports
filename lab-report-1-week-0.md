# **Week 0/Week 1**

For Week 0, we had to make our own websites for lab reports. In order to do so, I had to create a repository.

I had to click the “+” to create a new repository. Here, I was able to make a Pages site. I went into settings and clicked Pages. Below is what the Pages section looks like:

In order to launch the site, I had to make it first. I did so using the Github desktop and VS Code:

Each file contains a part of the website. Once I made some edits and markdowns (format, fonts, images, and links), I committed the changes and pushed them to origins:

Once I launched the website, my page was created:

For week 1, we learned how to use commands in the terminal. We learned the vocab that will be used and what each command means:

After learning what each command does, we put them into practice for the question below:

To answer this, we look at the commands. We know that cd changes the directory, so we typed cd lecture1/messages. Next, since cat prints the contents of the file(s), we typed cat en-us.txt es.mx.txt zh-cn.txt. The shorter method is to type cat lecture1/messages/en-us.txt… and write full paths for each language.

For this question, we had to examine each line. /Users/joe/lecture1/Hello.java and ../Hello.java are equivalent to each other because .. refers to everything before /Hello.java. ../lecture1/Hello.java is not equivalent because it’s basically saying /Users/joe/Users/joe/lecture1/lecture1/Hello.java.

For this lecture, we started off with answering this question. The remote computer/machine may be more powerful, there is better security, and there might be software in the remote machine that we need that the physical computer doesn’t have.

The last couple of things we learned are above. The scp command copies files from one computer to another. The ~ character (“tilde”) refers to your home directory.
