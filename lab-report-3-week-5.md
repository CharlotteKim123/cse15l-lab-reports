# **Week 5 - Lab Report 3: Grep**

## **Option #1: -l**

**Example #1**

```
# code block

charlottekim@Charlottes-MacBook-Air 911report % grep -l "chapter" *.txt 
chapter-1.txt
chapter-10.txt
chapter-11.txt
chapter-12.txt
chapter-13.1.txt
chapter-13.3.txt
chapter-13.4.txt
chapter-13.5.txt
chapter-2.txt
chapter-3.txt
chapter-5.txt
chapter-6.txt
chapter-7.txt
chapter-8.txt
chapter-9.txt

```
grep -l "chapter" *.txt returns the files that contains the word "chapter". This is helpful because instead of looking through each file to find which files have a word you're looking for, you can just type grep -l "chapter" *.txt. 

**Example #2**

```
# code block

charlottekim@Charlottes-MacBook-Air 911report % grep -l "chapter" chapter-3.txt
chapter-3.txt

```

I used grep -l "chapter" chapter-3.txt to check if "chapter" was in that file. This is helpful for you to check if a certain file has the word or phrase you're looking for.

**Example #3**

        even though there is little evidence that overweight is
        associated with increased mortality in those over age 65.
        Six large controlled population-based studies of
        non-smoking older adults have investigated the association
        between body mass index (BMI) and mortality, controlling
        for relevant covariates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . All studies found

        In older adults, risk factors may have a greater effect
        on health than on mortality. If so, then behavior change
        trials of weight modification might be more successful if
        they were evaluated on improved health, rather than on
        decreased mortality. Clinical trials powered to detect
        differences in YHL would often require fewer subjects than
--
          baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly,
          related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies,
          and likely to be related to BMI. Self-reported covariates

          mortality.

        Recommendations for desirable weight have been
        criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health. We
        found associations between YHL and obesity that were not
        present in the mortality analysis, suggesting that YHL may
        be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in

grep -1 "mortality" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt returns the paragraphs that contains the word "mortality" in the file 1468-6708-3-1.txt. This is useful to find certain paragraphs that contain the info you need.

## **Option #2: -o**

**Example #1**

```
# code block

charlottekim@Charlottes-MacBook-Air docsearch % grep -o "mortality" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt 
mortality
mortality
mortality
mortality
mortality
mortality

mortality

```

grep -o "mortality" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt returns every instance the word "mortality" shows up in the file 1468-6708-3-1.txt. This is helpful if you need to find how many instances of a word there are in a file.
 
**Example #2**

```
# code block

```

grep -o "help" *.txt returns every instance the word "mortality" shows up in the files that end in ".txt". This is helpful if you need to find how many instances of a word there are in all the files.

**Example #3**
