# **Lab Report 4**

## **Part 1**

**Changing the name of the start parameter and its uses to base**

The shortest sequence that was made in my group was:

/start > enter > dw > i > base > esc > n > (repeat dw > i > base >esc) > :wq > enter

1. Type vim DocSearchServer.java
2. Type “/start” and “enter” to find the word "start" in the code 
3. To delete "start", type “dw” 
4. Type “i” for insert mode and type “base” 
5. Type the esc key to go back to normal mode
6. Type “n” to go to the next instance of the word “start” and repeat steps 3 to 5 to delete the rest of them.
7. Once all the “start" words (except the last one) are changed to “base”, type “:wq” and press the enter key to save the changes in the file.

## **Part 2**

**Method 1**

The first method took me 300 seconds to do this method because scping the file was not working for a while, but ended up kind of working when I worked around it.

**Method 2**

This method took 120 seconds because I was already logged into a ssh session, which made the process much faster.

**Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?** 

I would prefer using the second method because it made the process a lot faster because trying to scp was not reliable for me.

**What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)**

None. My problems with scping has been happening on and off, so it would be easier for me to use the second method.
